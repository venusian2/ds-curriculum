Most common statistical tests are special cases of linear models, and linear models are the conceptual bridge between traditional statistics and machine learning.\n", "\n", "## Statistical Modeling\n", "\n", "First we'll set the stage by discussing how all statistical tests are based on underlying mathematical assumptions, and how we apply them to specific contexts. In particular we'll focus on ***linear models***.\n", "\n", "## Linear Regression\n", "\n", "The most basic linear model is a ***simple linear regression***, which looks like a basic _y = mx + b_ best-fit line.\n", "\n", "### Regression Model Evaluation\n", "\n", "> All models are wrong, but some are useful.

We'll practice setting up these models and interpreting their results.\n", "\n", "## Summary\n", "\n", "Congratulations, you've made it to statistical modeling! This portion of the course can be tough conceptually, but it underpins all kinds of statistical and machine learning approaches."]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python (learn-env)", "language": "python", "name": "learn-env"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.8.5"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
